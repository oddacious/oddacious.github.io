I thought I would share a select list of reading recommendations. My interests lie at some weird intersection of
economics, politics, and sports, so perhaps such a list would be rare to come by. Like much of the rest of this site,
this list also serves a dual purpose of existing for my personal reference. I didn't want to maintain links, but Google
will serve you well for finding these.

## Sports Analytics

There's no harm in leading with the most entertaining category. Silver's book in particular might be the best introductory example I
have of how to blend concepts with data to approach questions that are new to you, as well as how to communicate the
results to a general audience.

## Political Science, Political Economy, and Development Economics

This is an area that I find very motivating. These authors tackle big quesions, and they do so through careful thought
and quantitative analysis. There are many other great authors and pieces on how we ended up with our world and how we
could make it better, but these are some of my favourites. Reading Scott changed my way of thinking about organized 
government.

## Industry Studies

Sometimes we look exclusively at aggregates, to our own loss. Digging into specific situations can reveal a lot of
truth. These papers are all great reads.

## Machine Learning and Model Building

There are many other great references along these lines, but there is something in all of these that I don't want to
forget about.

## Economic Methods

Last, but close to my heart, here's where I reveal the inner econ nerd. Lucas' paper, so influential that it is known broadly
as the "Lucas critique", was an impassioned and well thought out call to arms for the field. Similarly, but far less
well known, Lehtinen and Kuorikoski's paper struck a cord with me and tackled some questions that I thought only I was
asking.
